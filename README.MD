## Overview

### The challenge

This a website that explains some concepts related to the bubble sort method. The user can see the definition of this method, some important concepts, and a demonstration of the code, besides it the user also can press a button and see a list of unsorted numbers be sorted.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

In this project I reinforced some knowledge related to HTML and CSS responsive and the most important, I've learned the meaning of sorting algorithms, specially the Bubble Sort method. This project was my first one applying concepts of Landing pages and modern designs. I've created a prototype in Figma, and then, I've reproduced it using HTML, CSS and Javascript. 


### Continued development

I'm satisfied with the final result. In my opinion the background is the keynote of this website, specially because the background fitted well with the computer photo. In terms of code, I've got a visible evolution compared to other websites that I've developed, in this code I tried to enhance the legibility and the clean-code practice.   


### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT] (https://chat.openai.com/share/420b41c3-5858-499e-80b0-00401590a275) - This specific use of ChatGPT helped me to fix the issues of the gap into the columns, the desktop/mobile images and the border-radius.
